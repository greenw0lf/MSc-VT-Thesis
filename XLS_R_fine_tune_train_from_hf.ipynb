    "**Wav2Vec2** is a pretrained model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and was released in [September 2020](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/wav2vec-20-learning-the-structure-of-speech-from-raw-audio/) by *Alexei Baevski, Michael Auli, and Alex Conneau*.  Soon after the superior performance of Wav2Vec2 was demonstrated on one of the most popular English datasets for ASR, called [LibriSpeech](https://huggingface.co/datasets/librispeech_asr), *Facebook AI* presented a multi-lingual version of Wav2Vec2, called [XLSR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13979). XLSR stands for *cross-lingual speech representations* and refers to model's ability to learn speech representations that are useful across multiple languages.\n",

    "XLSR's successor, simply called **XLS-R** (refering to the [*''XLM-R*](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/-xlm-r-state-of-the-art-cross-lingual-understanding-through-self-supervision/) *for Speech''*), was released in [November 2021](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/xls-r-self-supervised-speech-processing-for-128-languages) by *Arun Babu, Changhan Wang, Andros Tjandra, et al.* XLS-R used almost **half a million** hours of audio data in 128 languages for self-supervised pre-training and comes in sizes ranging from 300 milion up to **two billion** parameters. You can find the pretrained checkpoints on the 🤗 Hub:\n",
